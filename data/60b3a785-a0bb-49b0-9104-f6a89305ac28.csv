As for the feel and ambience, it was comfortable however it was pretty dim inside because of the lighting, it just feels that the warmth of the light was contrasting too much with the red couches/seats. The staff were accommodating and answered our queries in full.\n\nFor the food, I would like to emphasize first that my review of this may be heavily influenced by the imbalance of the types of food we ordered but nonetheless I'm still going to review each dish individually. Our appetizer was the pumpkin soup which was delicious, it had a great consistency as well as good serving size, perfect way to stimulate your appetite without an overpowering taste. The yang chow/fried rice was our favorite here, I feel I could eat this by itself! great ratio of rice and other ingredients. We ordered the Ox Sisig to try something new, it has what I believe are chicharon bulaklak in it, so good but if you're looking for crunchy sisig this is not for you, delicious still. There was also Slow Braised Pork Belly, so tender that it falls apart while trying to grab a serving, there was a strong taste that overpowered the dish itself that I cannot quite point out (tasted kind of and was probably a strong spice) but maybe less of that it could've been really good too, I was expecting something similar to hong shou rou. Lastly, the beef tenderloin rolls with cheese and teriyaki sauce, this made me lose my appetite, the cheese was overkill, couldn't even taste any of the beef, just cheese, it even beats the taste of the teriyaki sauce. In the end, we finished the soup, ox sisig, and fried rice. Some of the servings are worth their price and taste, some aren't. Will still go back because we're hoping to try the other dishes especially the lengua and the crispy pork belly in hoisin glaze."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNRO4a4gRa_Xxj7xMKv01QJWGJ1v03fwuAP07JF""],""When"":""2024-5-3""},{""Name"":""Paris London"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWgQC2OJqM6mOQr-guvjkEV8CP0O0nEYwQhpWbN733e33dyp8NE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Mixed  Asian  cuisine presented differently and non-traditionally.

If you're a Filipino, you might feel like a 2nd class customer/tourist unless your clothes are all gold plated and diamond crusted.\n\nIt took us a while for the staff to take our order. After our order was taken, it took more time for our food to be served than other people who came in later than we did. They got their food served first even though they had a larger quantity of food.\n\nThe food itself does taste fine but overall, it tastes mid. We ordered the Klassic Kare Kare, Crispy Pata, and some garlic rice.\n\nWhen we finished our food and asked for our bill, again, other people's bill got taken of first before ours did. When our change was given, the manager(?)/senior staff just slid the bill over to us rudely while I noticed that he gave it politely to the aforementioned people before us. The senior staff that did this was a balding middle aged fat man with glasses. Mind you, we paid our bill in full which was NOT inexpensive.\n\nIt is very ironic that a restaurant that serves Filipino food would treat one of their own like this. I fully understand that food service industry is a very demanding job, however we still expect a decent customer service considering the price you are charging your customers with.\n\nFor people looking for a place to eat reading this review, you can still eat here but just wear a big diamond necklace so you can expect decent service."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNeAEumZEi7BSlamGwTtzoGwGFyWVKBbEobiUkY""],""When"":""2023-9-17""},{""Name"":""Wei Ming Tan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXBXN3k1cRsTUJCHaFtSO-Vy4l5E3ZGC4pDRrlDe0KcnmQf1WQqKA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Most delectable local cuisine - it's like granny's home cooked food.

The cultural show (think musicians and dance performancea) was the absolute highlight. It was truly special. As a filipina-american born in the USA, I felt proud to be a Filipina. I got emotional watching it. You're allowed to take pics and video of the performances. After the show, they invite guests on the dance floor/stage to learn tinikling with the guidance of a professional dance partner. Tinikling is a traditional Filipino dance involving bamboo stilts. I did it, it's fun! Then you can take a group pic with the dancers later. No additional fee, but they lay a hat on the ground if you want to leave a tip. They aren't pushy about it. The hostess also made other special announcements to recognize birthdays and foreign travelers visiting the Philippines for the first time.\n\nWe did the dinner buffet and called ahead earlier in the day to make a reservation for two. I'm glad that we did.  I was concerned there wouldn't be any food left since we arrived at 7:07pm (buffet started at 630p). There was a good amount of food left, room temperature as other reviews mentioned. Some food items were refilled. The leche flan was long gone lol. Drinks were additional. I ordered the calamansi juice and if had a flowery taste one that I'm not used to, but if was still drinkable. My husband ordered soursop juice. Total cost for buffet dinner + 2 drinks was  3,500 PHP or $62 USD. Worth it for the show imo.\n\nAlso, plan for traffic. I stayed in Makati about 3 miles away and our Grab ride took 45 minutes. Thankfully, the show started around 7:20 pm and lasted an hour. We found a Grab driver easily after dinner. If you have a long wait before your driver arrives, walk around the corner to take pics in the small beautiful courtyard next to the restaurant.

The inclusion of the French pastries is quite strange considering that they’re not very good. Roast beef could use some work, it is quite tough\n\nAmbience: Very good. The restaurant is set inside a traditional Filipino bahay-na-bato house and in general feels very Filipino. There is a live band performing along with a dance performance which really ups the ambience factor. The food was okay but the ambience was bliss!

expected more. For the original price of 1,998 (999 if you used a voucher) you'd expect a lot of dishes - sashimi for example, and a more diverse selection but the selection was like less than 25-30 dishes in total.\n\nService was great, no doubt. The servers were really attentive and fast so 5/5 for them.\n\nFor the atmosphere and ambience, also 5/5 because the place was clean and aesthetic.\n\nBut for the food, I'm sorry but I can only give 2/5 stars. I didn't get my money's worth. The selection was too small. Food itself didn't taste like \""wow this is amazing\"" and it's more like \""oh okay\"". I was really sad there was no sashimi and not much food to choose from. The only dish I liked was the pasta that was prepared to your preference. Crepe was -1/5 :(\n\nAll in all, would I come back?

If you're a Filipino, you might feel like a 2nd class customer/tourist unless your clothes are all gold plated and diamond crusted.\n\nIt took us a while for the staff to take our order.

They got their food served first even though they had a larger quantity of food.\n\nThe food itself does taste fine but overall, it tastes mid. We ordered the Klassic Kare Kare, Crispy Pata, and some garlic rice.\n\nWhen we finished our food and asked for our bill, again, other people's bill got taken of first before ours did. When our change was given, the manager(?)/senior staff just slid the bill over to us rudely while I noticed that he gave it politely to the aforementioned people before us. The senior staff that did this was a balding middle aged fat man with glasses.

here and we really enjoyed the food! My dad’s an Ilokano and he was so happy to have found a restaurant that mainly serves Ilokano dishes. We got Fiesta Rice (5/5), Ensaladang Swa (5/5) the dressing was so yummy!, Pinirito nga Baby Pusit (4/5)- the quantity is just so little but it’s yummy!, Lumpiang Tinapa Flakes (4/5), Karabasa Soup, Ladec (4/5)- wish this was more crunchy, Kinilaw Tanigue (2/5)- have high standards for Kinilaw and it was just not it sadly. But I feel like pwede na siya here sa Manila haha,\nAdobong Kambing (4/5) - love the garlic confit and the meat was so tender, again portion size lang talaga medyo sad but it’s yummy!.\n\nFor drinks we got Dalandan Shake, Pomelo Shake, Watermelon Shake, and Sago’t Gulaman. All great, didn’t know you could shake Pomelo 😅\n\nFor dessert, we had the Pistachio Sanseival and NY Cheesecake. Both were also so good.\n\nAll in all the food was yummy the only set back was the staff. Medyo ma-attitude lang sila and we were seated right in front of the bar so servers were quite loud, mas malakas pa sila mag chikahan haha. Other than that atmosphere was great except for the SOBRANG DAMING LANGAW.

We always loved the food here. When we arrived at 1:30pm, the ambiance was peaceful as usual, just the way we like it. Their security guard assisted us with the parking and Clark the server was very friendly and attentive. Their food is always good! It never disappoints. However, we were upset when they told us they can’t separate the igado sauce from the pork anymore (photo attached was from our previous visit). We totally understand the chef’s policy. I don’t usually give low ratings but I’m really disappointed with the other server who bust out our plates, the way he took our plates is really irresponsible. He ended up spilling a lot of vinegar in my louis vuitton bag. I don’t want to name drop but his colleague, Clark, knows his name. The server also had ego when we called him out, on his defense, he’s just newly hired, he didn’t saw my bag placed in the seat. I would understand if he just say that he’s sorry since I know he won’t pay for the damage. So, they just randomly spill food/condiments at their chairs? I don’t understand. Additionally, what’s inside my bag is my Passport and Passbook since we’re heading to the bank after. Thank God, there’s no marks but it really smells! Is that how Victorino’s train their employees?

I sampled their Shawarma Rice and Chicken Kabsa, finding the former to be good but somewhat lacking in portion size compared to other options at a similar price point. However, the Chicken Kabsa was a standout, boasting tender meat infused with delightful spices, accentuated by their irresistible garlic sauce.\n\nThen during my second visit to Saffron, accompanied by a friend who had an insatiable craving for their Shawarma Rice (he ordered two servings, by the way), I decided to switch things up and try the Sharooq. The dish surpassed my expectations, offering a burst of flavors that left me thoroughly satisfied, especially when paired with their delectable garlic sauce. It's safe to say I'll be revisiting someday to indulge in the Sharooq again. Despite the worn-down walls and ceilings in some parts of the interior, the flavorful offerings of Saffron remain the highlight of the dining experience.\n\n— Ah, adding to the ambiance, they also provides a cozy setting with board games like Uno and Jenga available for customers to enjoy. It's a nice touch, adding an element of fun and entertainment to the dining experience, especially when shared with friends.\n\nedit ㅡ During my recent visit (maybe my 3rd) to Saffron, I decided to try the Sharooq platter for the first time. This option, which includes the flavorful Sharooq alongside fries and a serving of garlic sauce, comes at just a 20 PHP (afair) difference from the standalone Sharooq. It's worth noting that while the Sharooq is still covered with tin foil for freshness, in the platter, they cut it into portions along with the tin foil. Diners should be cautious of the tin foil while enjoying their meal. Despite this minor consideration, the Sharooq lived up to its reputation, tantalizing taste buds and leaving me thoroughly satisfied. With this satisfying meal option available, Saffron continues to impress with both flavor and value."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""JM Manuel"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXujCxgu8IkWh_lPjESmXZa_G8A9GBXbOZ2H1OyMjhmf7WcKH_G=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Very delicious food.. same taste like middle east shawarma, kabsa and fries and even sauces..  very yummy.. thank you."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM41A-wBTXFvqLa_BGViTe-IXigcUM9atF6WanH""],""When"":""2023-5-18""},{""Name"":""ACM"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWSzv7S-JKQzZ5Asz6XPdFBTsfPmkjlmlZsDtkyLhAckLt3Fdb4iQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""One of the first and very few authentic middle eastern restaurants nearby UST.

The meat dishes are also good as well. My personal favorite is the bread with artichoke then have their free herbed bread dip on it. You can have UNLI refill for the service bread which makes the place having good value for money. If you have a BFF card you will save tons of money since they give generous discount. They also give free coffee which is really good when you have the card. The Caesar salad is also good especially the dressing and you can ask the waitress to add additional dressing for free. The biggest discount is on monday which will give you thirty percent discount for every transaction. The staffs are also giving super service, they are kind and attentive to your needs. I didnt have to tell them when i want a refill a water in my glass. They automatically refill it when it was 1/4 empty. This is a go to Italian restaurant that is worth the value on your money.

Thinking of a Filipino restaurant to bring balikbayan friends, my niece suggested Sarsa and the food did not disappoint. Everything we ordered was delicious. Their PALABOK ESPESYAL  is he best I've tasted, better than Via Mare and Milky Way. The sauce was delicious, and not starchy, the noodles al dente.  And the toppings - Longganisa, shrimp, chicharron, smoked fish, squid, egg . Heaven! Writing about it makes me want to go back now.\n\nThe 3 way pork sisis was equally a winner, as well as the laing and kinilaw. We ordered the right combo.\n\nThe only slight disappointment was the chicken breast Inasal, which in fact we did not finish to the bone.  Perhaps the thigg part would have been better.\n\nOut dessert was leche flan - which had the consistency of yema.  It was too compactvand sweet, chuckloads of condensed milk . We wish we had ordered the turon with ube ice cream - saw our neighbor's order of it!  But we were too full for another dessert.\n\nService was reasonably acceptable except for the peppermint tea ( not complicated, right) which we had to follow up from 3 waiters about 4-5 times.\n\nMusic was a bit too loud , an issue in restaurants here.  So the music plus occasionally boisterous diners - not a relaxing atmosohere.

Here are some highlights of our experience in Sarsa:\n\n1. RESERVATIONS 3/5 - They’re very accessible via Viber and they easily confirmed our reservation. However, we were placed next to the door. There were 2 separate couples that did walk-ins, but they got the table with the booth. We did asked to be placed somewhere else, but we still ended up being near the door. During our meal, two flies keep flying around our food.\n\n2. FOOD 3/5. We ordered Chicken Isaw, Molo Soup, Palabok, Sizzling Kansi, Tortang talong, and 3-way Sisig. In general, the food was ‘lasang malinis’.\n\n(1) Chicken isaw (2/5) was dry, leathery, not juicy, no flavor except it was charred.\n(2) Molo Soup (3/5) was served beautifully but Maam’s hastened presentation put the dish off; I like the idea of fried wanton with the soup, however, it went soggy afterwards.\n(3) Palabok (2/5) was creamy but I dont know why. Maybe that was the twist? It lacked saltiness from the sahog which shouldve balanced the dish. The noodles used were thick since it was ‘pansit luglug’.\n(4) Tortang talong (2/5) was your traditional tortang talong but they tried to\nupscale it by placing fried alamang on the side and a minute amount of crab meat at the center of the torta.\n(5) For the 3-way Sisig (2/5), the 1st third of the meat was boiled, 2nd third was fried and last third, I think, was buttered. I did not like the fact that I was that trying to be very careful with my bites/chewing just because some meats were heavily fried which gives the pork a hard/rock-like consistency.\n(6) Sizzling kansi (5/5) was the only remarkable dish I had. I love that it was reduced so the reduced cream was rich in beef, broth and asim. Kahit ito na lang iorder ninyo at kanin.\n\nI think I marked it low due to my expectations that the meals are outstanding based on articles available online. But in general, they did serve the food in the most honest way without any tricks or surprises.\n\n3. VALUE FOR MONEY (2.5/5) - Yes for the experience. But I wont recommend others from going here. I will ask them instead to go to Gerry’s for Sisig and Palabok, Manam for Isaw/BBQ/Skewers, or Locavore for food with Filipino twists. We spent 3.2k for the whole meal."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOcmS9EWrv4valNVS7yt7iGr23QdO4nJpZGZnJV""],""When"":""2024-6-10""},{""Name"":""Kat CM"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUnFdDpBQOqXAOsb7fhkpDXfqfxLRO8A19KulX0x1fvGrENmCw2qQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food is easily a 5 - one you’d recommend to family and friends.

Excellent, well balanced food all around, tastefully designed dining space, and warm staff to top the experience off.\n\nWe grabbed a few drinks to start our lunch: I had the Sago’t Gulaman and my husband had the Lemongrass. First thing that hit me was that the Gulaman wasn’t overly sweet. I enjoyed the fact that I could taste the herby notes of the grass jelly. For our first main meal, we had the Palabok. Again, well balanced. Chicharon isn’t the only thing I taste, I was able to appreciate the marriage of flavors that all the ingredients brought. Next, we had the 3-Way Pork Sisig and Inasal Paa. Both packed a punch with flavor but not to the point where one would get “umay” easily because of the excessive oiliness. We ended our lunch with the Halo-Halo and Piaya. The Halo-Halo was just like the gulaman- not overly sweet so that you can enjoy all the diverse flavors going on in the dessert. I also love that they were generous with their serving of Ube ice cream as well as the Ube syrup. The only real anomaly in all the dishes we enjoyed was the Piaya. I enjoyed the fact that it was more plump and moist than the usual piaya, which tends to be flat and crumbly. It came with a good serving of Coconut Jam to dip it in but I didn’t feel the need only because the piaya itself was extra sweet. If it wasn’t as sweet, I would have gladly scooped dollops of that coconut jam since it paired so nicely.\n\nNevertheless, it was such a great experience and we felt like we only skimmed the surface of what Sarsa has to offer. We left with our tummies and hearts filled to the brim.\n\nPro-Tip: We came on a weekday but the place was packed as soon as the clock struck twelve. Be sure to be there by 11, right when they open."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPUTXI67LdfGy2RVqMjBEO0zENdrnAeVckba5dL""],""When"":""2024-4-19""}]",

place to eat when in Manila “BUT” recently I got pretty disappointed with their food. presentation and service went from excellent to terrible. I Booked a private room with 4 big tables for my husband birthday. when we got there the room wasn’t ready, servers are nowhere to be found, the room was under a wrong name. Food was served extremely slow! We have to ask several times before they start bringing in food and water! Presentation wasn’t great, some food was over cooked. rice was served late (guests are eating the food without rice.) everything was served late and with two missing orders in one of the tables. Everything was set and ordered few days ahead so I wasn’t expecting that this will turn into a big mess which left me disappointed. Servers are somehow nice but the manager is rude. He never showed up in our room to ask or check if everything is okay (I see him walking in and out the other room checking if their food and if everything is complete). I feel embarrassed that my guests wasn’t able to enjoy the food which also ruined the mood of the celebration. With all this and with the price they charge me I won’t be using this restaurant on any kind of celebration anymore."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPpETwuWDWcHQ43sJrOINLwxEvox5XKJrIB-khI""],""When"":""2024-8-18""},{""Name"":""Travel Tan"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU0hQWVxpujhKj9XLTKmsHfAorpN9wZWpzF0hbbn8qtR6ZukzBULA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""Chinese food is always good here at East Ocean.

Though I find a single piece of it  small for the price.\n\nShiitake and Tofu Kare-kare was good. The sauce was creamy delicious, although not the traditional creamy taste I was expecting. It tasted like they used peanut butter. It's alright though. What caught my attention was the taste of the Shiitake mushroom. It still tasted bitter and earthy. And only a couple of pechay stalks and a lot of sitaw was there for veggies.\n\nAs for the Sweet Mango and Kesong Puti Turon, I found the Ice Cream they used so overwhelmingly sweet. I was looking for the kesong puti, but it's nowhere to be found. I weren't able to taste it in the dessert to think I ordered it for my kesong puti craving.\n\nOverall, I find the food average.

One thing with buffets even the best ones that cost 4k+, some are inevitably going to be dry or overcooked when it comes to their meat and seafood. Not Gueverras. They were perfectly cooked and tasty! With possibly the best and most affordable price for a buffet like this. We went on father's day (waited because we had no reservation), it was 799php and it was so worth it for all the meats, lots of sauce options, multiple soda and juices and even gulaman included. They also have free birthday cakes (and as of when we went, they didn't check and servers seemed happy to serve them anyway). The place is very home-y and is a traditional filipino house too. They have their own parking lot as well. Service is good. They do require you to wear a mask (which they provide) when you enter the buffet area. No problems with it personally, just surprising but better safe than sorry! I definitely recommend for everyone!\n\nThe only food I didn't like was their paella. The rice was overcooked and TOO sticky so it actually tasted more like chinese machang.

The place itself was cozy and breezy (dahil gloomy din ang weather) esp when we went inside. Pagpasok palang, you’ll feel how homey the place is and staffs were everywhere to welcome guests. It was great that they placed us in Abad Santos room. Spacious enough for the 15 of us (with addtl 2 chairs pa), hindi siksikan. The washroom was also nearby.\n\nAs for the main part…the chibog, a lot of great feedback were shared here, and true enough, meats were the highlight. Not dry and super tasty. The best bagnet bacon and lechon! Lechon melts in your mouth. Even the roast beef was good. As for drinks, no free coffee but it’s just P50. Really liked their home brewed iced tea. In terms of cleanliness, i liked the way they ensure no contaminants in their food. Not only that there’s covered glass on top of the food, they also require mask, which they provide before entering the main buffet area ✨\n\nStaffs were awesome! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Service at its finest. Salamat po :) Mukhang ito na ang go to buffet namin, may celebration man or just simple cravings 😅 vs other well-known buffet places.

The meat dishes are also good as well. My personal favorite is the bread with artichoke then have their free herbed bread dip on it. You can have UNLI refill for the service bread which makes the place having good value for money. If you have a BFF card you will save tons of money since they give generous discount. They also give free coffee which is really good when you have the card. The Caesar salad is also good especially the dressing and you can ask the waitress to add additional dressing for free. The biggest discount is on monday which will give you thirty percent discount for every transaction. The staffs are also giving super service, they are kind and attentive to your needs. I didnt have to tell them when i want a refill a water in my glass. They automatically refill it when it was 1/4 empty. This is a go to Italian restaurant that is worth the value on your money.

They got toilet as well\n\nFood is Great!! Small quantity serving and expensive but for us it's worth it.

I recommend the Catfish salad, chicken with lemongrass and Pad Thai, good for 2 - 3 person.

on a Saturday noon to have a family lunch. Fortunately, the place was still uncrowded when we arrived. Service crew was very attentive and approachable right from the get-go.\n\nHere’s a rundown of what we have ordered.\nWe had the Braised Beef Noodle for out soup which tastes very rich and has a powerful kick in it. For the dumplings, we tried their original Xiao Long Bao which I find very appetizing. Might say that I find their XLBs way better than those of other Chinese restaurants so far. Spicy Shrimp and Pork Wonton live up to its name with right amount of spice. We also tried their Char Siu Pork Bao which I personally like since the meat melts in my mouth and has this very sweet and savory taste that comes with it.\n\nFor the mains, we got the Spicy Spare Ribs and the Cantonese Style Fish Fillet. Both dishes were very delicious. The dishes were seasoned and were really tasty. Of course we had one of their rice to sum it up.\n\nMilk Tea tasted authentic and really up to our liking since it not sweet. Green Mango Shake was decent. I was curious about the Crimson Berry and gave it a try. It was basically a raspberry drink kind of thing which was sweet, cool and refreshing.\n\nShi Lin is a must for Chinese cuisine lovers.

Filling was porky soy sauce sweet like asado or hoisin but mild. Kikiam was mild savory sweet \u0026 flavor can be  dominated by the same sweet-soy thick sauce  that came with the sipa.  Stuffed tofu was like braised tofu in mild oyster sauce with the stuffing, having a little smell, adding savoryness to the sauce still, tofu flavor dominated and was accented by its sauce.

since my last visit to Sarsa.  Thinking of a Filipino restaurant to bring balikbayan friends, my niece suggested Sarsa and the food did not disappoint. Everything we ordered was delicious. Their PALABOK ESPESYAL  is he best I've tasted, better than Via Mare and Milky Way. The sauce was delicious, and not starchy, the noodles al dente.  And the toppings - Longganisa, shrimp, chicharron, smoked fish, squid, egg . Heaven! Writing about it makes me want to go back now.\n\nThe 3 way pork sisis was equally a winner, as well as the laing and kinilaw. We ordered the right combo.\n\nThe only slight disappointment was the chicken breast Inasal, which in fact we did not finish to the bone.  Perhaps the thigg part would have been better.\n\nOut dessert was leche flan - which had the consistency of yema.  It was too compactvand sweet, chuckloads of condensed milk . We wish we had ordered the turon with ube ice cream - saw our neighbor's order of it!  But we were too full for another dessert.\n\nService was reasonably acceptable except for the peppermint tea ( not complicated, right) which we had to follow up from 3 waiters about 4-5 times.\n\nMusic was a bit too loud , an issue in restaurants here.  So the music plus occasionally boisterous diners - not a relaxing atmosohere.  But ...\n\nAll in all, a very satisfying meal for everyone."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNhT13WZ5AlEzn8BuaXkngxQduZ6g8GC0ocXiiG""],""When"":""2024-8-22""},{""Name"":""andi j"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIPYGNl1C_osLW1VJw6aNkN2VRAtDVkCBEUIBCs38Smc4Ae8kM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""My go-to for Ilonggo food.

Here are some highlights of our experience in Sarsa:\n\n1. RESERVATIONS 3/5 - They’re very accessible via Viber and they easily confirmed our reservation. However, we were placed next to the door. There were 2 separate couples that did walk-ins, but they got the table with the booth. We did asked to be placed somewhere else, but we still ended up being near the door. During our meal, two flies keep flying around our food.\n\n2. FOOD 3/5. We ordered Chicken Isaw, Molo Soup, Palabok, Sizzling Kansi, Tortang talong, and 3-way Sisig. In general, the food was ‘lasang malinis’.\n\n(1) Chicken isaw (2/5) was dry, leathery, not juicy, no flavor except it was charred.\n(2) Molo Soup (3/5) was served beautifully but Maam’s hastened presentation put the dish off; I like the idea of fried wanton with the soup, however, it went soggy afterwards.\n(3) Palabok (2/5) was creamy but I dont know why. Maybe that was the twist? It lacked saltiness from the sahog which shouldve balanced the dish. The noodles used were thick since it was ‘pansit luglug’.\n(4) Tortang talong (2/5) was your traditional tortang talong but they tried to\nupscale it by placing fried alamang on the side and a minute amount of crab meat at the center of the torta.\n(5) For the 3-way Sisig (2/5), the 1st third of the meat was boiled, 2nd third was fried and last third, I think, was buttered. I did not like the fact that I was that trying to be very careful with my bites/chewing just because some meats were heavily fried which gives the pork a hard/rock-like consistency.\n(6) Sizzling kansi (5/5) was the only remarkable dish I had. I love that it was reduced so the reduced cream was rich in beef, broth and asim. Kahit ito na lang iorder ninyo at kanin.\n\nI think I marked it low due to my expectations that the meals are outstanding based on articles available online. But in general, they did serve the food in the most honest way without any tricks or surprises.\n\n3. VALUE FOR MONEY (2.5/5) - Yes for the experience. But I wont recommend others from going here. I will ask them instead to go to Gerry’s for Sisig and Palabok, Manam for Isaw/BBQ/Skewers, or Locavore for food with Filipino twists. We spent 3.2k for the whole meal."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOcmS9EWrv4valNVS7yt7iGr23QdO4nJpZGZnJV""],""When"":""2024-6-10""},{""Name"":""Kat CM"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUnFdDpBQOqXAOsb7fhkpDXfqfxLRO8A19KulX0x1fvGrENmCw2qQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Food is easily a 5 - one you’d recommend to family and friends.

Better if they could serve the appetizer first before the heavy meals without customers having to request it.\n\nInterior is nice, well-lit and ventilated/airconditioned.

Excellent, well balanced food all around, tastefully designed dining space, and warm staff to top the experience off.\n\nWe grabbed a few drinks to start our lunch: I had the Sago’t Gulaman and my husband had the Lemongrass. First thing that hit me was that the Gulaman wasn’t overly sweet. I enjoyed the fact that I could taste the herby notes of the grass jelly. For our first main meal, we had the Palabok. Again, well balanced. Chicharon isn’t the only thing I taste, I was able to appreciate the marriage of flavors that all the ingredients brought. Next, we had the 3-Way Pork Sisig and Inasal Paa. Both packed a punch with flavor but not to the point where one would get “umay” easily because of the excessive oiliness. We ended our lunch with the Halo-Halo and Piaya. The Halo-Halo was just like the gulaman- not overly sweet so that you can enjoy all the diverse flavors going on in the dessert. I also love that they were generous with their serving of Ube ice cream as well as the Ube syrup. The only real anomaly in all the dishes we enjoyed was the Piaya. I enjoyed the fact that it was more plump and moist than the usual piaya, which tends to be flat and crumbly. It came with a good serving of Coconut Jam to dip it in but I didn’t feel the need only because the piaya itself was extra sweet. If it wasn’t as sweet, I would have gladly scooped dollops of that coconut jam since it paired so nicely.\n\nNevertheless, it was such a great experience and we felt like we only skimmed the surface of what Sarsa has to offer. We left with our tummies and hearts filled to the brim.\n\nPro-Tip: We came on a weekday but the place was packed as soon as the clock struck twelve. Be sure to be there by 11, right when they open."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPUTXI67LdfGy2RVqMjBEO0zENdrnAeVckba5dL""],""When"":""2024-4-19""}]",

Bolognese spaghetti is okay, nothing special like back home in the West or the U.S. Praline nougat ice cream is overpriced and abysmally small.\n\nFried Calamari was okay, the grilled salmon and spinach were good but overpriced.\n\nThe bread and olive oil dip were excellent.\n\nI'd give the pizza a 7/10 from what I've tasted here and elsewhere, though in the U.S. I've certainly had better, though it's made by actual Italians or Italian-Americans.

ITS THE MOST EXPENSIVE ESPRESSO IN THE PHILIPPINES. We ordered 2 espressos and the waiter asked if we wanted a single or double. I said double, and my companion said single. They charged P620 for the double and P310 for the single. With VAT and service charge, 2 CUPS OF COFFEE COST P1,134.60!\n\nThe food, on the other hand, was quite good. The risotto nero was outstanding.\n\nOverall, it was a good dining experience until  we discovered the price of the espressos. No diner will ask for the menu again just to check the price of coffee. We just assume it'll be a reasonable price.\n\nWhen we checked after the bill came (we couldn't believe it,  and thought it was a cashier error), we saw that P310 was indeed the price of an espresso. THERE WAS NO PRICE ON THE MENU FOR A DOUBLE ESPRESSO, (P620) FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. Yet the first thing the waiter asked was whether we wanted a single or double. Not sure if the restaurant owner knows about this practice, but buyer beware.\n\nHope this review helps others avoid (intentional?) overpricing by this otherwise decent establishment."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipP5LKDRCm6vCu1gbzZA2DvF-7m_0aOnN4Tp7kgr""],""When"":""2024-7-31""},{""Name"":""Leonard Lam"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFPXYrpNzgP9-A_2iJ3oLrNG8Ke3X5-guVwWEVHMPuamkm0uio=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""First time here with friends total of 6 pax, had been order their famous steak for sharing, 2 types of salads, 2 types of famous pizzas, 3 types of soups (Mushroom, tomato, tomato with seafoods and quite tasty by eating with the breads) and 4 types of pastas ( I dont remember all the names and took all pictures so far as recommended by the staffs for their best sellers)\n\nOverall the ambience are so good, so quite for gathering or for dating, staffs are friendly and pro with well manners, got some parking lot from outside and even let us in without reservation as we just pass by and decided to having dinner from here.\n\nWe will definitely visited once again~ :))"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM2elqEDljGhkhVWqJvrfrLFcXvMSVu7a8o8ogO""],""When"":""2023-2-19""},{""Name"":""Willie Aquino"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWVdf-6VbKHOSQP0nWeLkfKk8ZLTRsajNSSm7GndVclgcq41VQH-Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great food.

About Php 400++\n\nThe refreshing and yummy beef pho seems good for two. About Php 400\n\nSpring roll was fresh, but dip too spicy.\nWas first told it was ok, the pork and shrimp spring roll can be made into tofu and shrimp. But then after a while he returned saying it cannot be pala. Just tofu only, and remove both pork and shrimp for the same price.  Since lugi so I just said ok just make it into original (seems my switch made the kitchen staff annoyed).
