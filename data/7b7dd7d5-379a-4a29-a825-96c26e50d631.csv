I proposed to add it to my room for a later payment at the desk, he didn't want to, but asked my room first so I dont know why, and I finally paid by cash, BUT they didnt have cash and told me they will give me the change later at my room lol...

I just wanted to share what a horrible experienced i had in this hotel branch. So my boyfriend booked me an executive room on the 4th of October for my stay on the 5th of October, so i'll have a place to stay for that night as i was going to attend a friends birthday and i came from Cavite and would have a hard time travelling late night. I was there around 3:30 pm 5th of October, and confirmed my booking at the front desk and they assured the room my boyfriend booked for me, I also informed them that i'll be coming back late night to get my room key as i might lose it. I got back at the hotel around 2 am as i am exhausted from the travel in Quezon city, went to the front desk and asked for my room key which unfortunately took them longer than it should be, the  supervisor asked me to follow him to this room that unfortunately they are still trying to prepare, when i got there i told him that, that's not the room my boyfriend booked me, and i showed him the picture of the room that they sent him, without any explanation the supervisor left me in the room along with the employee cleaning, and while i was waiting by myself the power turned off so i decided to go back to the front desk because its taking them so long and i'm exhausted and sleepy when i got there, surprisingly the supervisor was there  but then left again, while i still have questions. The front desk employee was apologizing on behalf of her supervisor. Again they gave me a wrong room and the supervisor was insisting it is the actual same room when its not. the supervisor was so unprofessional, other guests also complaining with their system and how they handle situations.I stayed there for the night, exhausted,extremely disappointed, and frustrated, I was also in a hospitality service,and based on how i got treated, it was so unacceptable and would absolutely never ever book on that hotel ever again and would never recommend it to my travelling friends.I highly suggest they train their hotel management  employee how to handle guests and certain situations professionally so things like this don't happen again."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Alec Yllan Penilla"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLV9vYguBDe74DnUDdN5VQCbpo0atTb0ubLEz5cDMaxNWUJqw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Highly recommendable.

The first Hotel in Manila with a good (very good) Price/Quality ratio. I read some comments here and in Agoda, and check them...\nSmell in the aisle? No. We visit 3 storey, all clean, all carpets are clean.\n30 Minutes for hot Water? No. First warm water after 5 seconds or more early, becomes hot after maybe 10 seconds. The Warm and Cold water is pumping, so the temperature pumps between OK and very warm or between \""Little bit cold\"" and OK, but no problem to take a nice and good shower with good water pressure.\nThe Rooms are very spacious. We are upgraded because our booked room class was under renovation, and the room was great. OK, the style was 60th in germany, the wallpapers needs to be fixed, but thats all. Aircon: Clean. You smell, when a Aircon is not cleaned for long time. No smell here. Split type Aircon, very silent, good for sleep. Real Window, so you can get in fresh ocean air (in the morning, it is Manila...).\nLocation: Sea side of Makati, in front of the Mall of Asia. A lot of shops and restaurants (and Laundry shops, and massage, and...) around the corner or just in front of the hotel, 10 Minutes Walk to the MOA. In the night nice view to the lights of the MOA. You have a nice small rooftop pool, BBQ at the roof, a \""more than good enough\"" Restaurant (Golden Spices) in the Hotel, a spacious Bar/Bistro (Amore) at the 2nd floor.\nA little bit funny: You need to take the escalators (or elevator) to get to the 2nd floor and then walk to the guest Elevators, maybe not the first choice if you can not/hardly walk.\nWe would always book this Hotel again, the Service is so friendly, rooms are high and spacious, Price is affordable, environment is great... Fast check in: The registration form was already pre-filled, so the whole check in process needs something like 2 Minutes, that's very fast for the Philippines.\nRoom and shower (good for 2) are absolute clean, the bathroom mirror are 95% brilliant clean, the room mirror is 100% brilliant clean. to compare: In average, also in good hotels, the mirrors look like a child played on it with ice cream and a nutella bread...\nTowels are fluffy, and the bedding and linen are super soft and smooth and silky. In a rainy season you can easy spend 2 Days only at the hotel because everything is wide and bright. I can not understand other complains here, but i am happy to become curious and test it for ourself.\nInternet could have a bigger capacity, but Ping is very good (191 ms to denic/germany). One of the fastest possible pin gin the Philippines. Download is not that amazing, i think their Bandwidth is short for a lot of customers. But good enough for Video Calls!\n6 elevators, but only 2 for the guest, means Apartment renter use their own elevators. Both guest elevators working, short waiting times, access only by keycard.\nBreakfast is Asian style, no continental breakfast. But good enough for 2 or more days.

Other customers also experience the same.\n\nOn the day of the check-in, my mom and younger sister were let in only by saying my name. No IDs. No confirmation from my end. Which is a big red flag! They might be letting in strangers!! I arrived a little late that day. Upon arriving, the place looks like a normal house in a residential subdivision. Entrance was barely lit. The hallways are reminiscent of dark alleys in horror movies; you wouldn't dare to walk alone. Upon entering the room, it's got a unique smell. There are two single beds as booked but only one has a mattress. The pillows are also stained. But what caught our attention is what seems like another sketchy door in the room with an empty bed in front of it. The bathroom also has a scary hole in the ceiling, atop the toilet bowl itself. What made us decide to leave that night was when we heard screeching noises and scratches. Also, the weird vacant room was really unsettling. We're tired but we went home instead. We don't wanna stress ourselves anymore!\n\nAs we leave the premises, people at front desk just took our keys. No questions. Didn't even check our room and just let us go. Totally a horrible experience. Can't forget the unlit hallways leading to the elevator. We're scared for life we thought we'd never get out of there alive.

They ignored me then on the day of the reservation sent me countless emails, followed the next day by a week-in-advance message telling me I was all set for next week. I have never NOT had a response from a hotel and to ignore the company that markets your hotel is morally wrong. They are in one of the most popular areas for tourists and as a cheap hotel, they could easily resell this during that period.

Good thing customer service was kind enough to confirm that it's just the system malfunctioning. Other customers also experience the same.\n\nOn the day of the check-in, my mom and younger sister were let in only by saying my name. No IDs. No confirmation from my end. Which is a big red flag! They might be letting in strangers!! I arrived a little late that day. Upon arriving, the place looks like a normal house in a residential subdivision. Entrance was barely lit. The hallways are reminiscent of dark alleys in horror movies; you wouldn't dare to walk alone. Upon entering the room, it's got a unique smell. There are two single beds as booked but only one has a mattress. The pillows are also stained. But what caught our attention is what seems like another sketchy door in the room with an empty bed in front of it. The bathroom also has a scary hole in the ceiling, atop the toilet bowl itself. What made us decide to leave that night was when we heard screeching noises and scratches. Also, the weird vacant room was really unsettling. We're tired but we went home instead. We don't wanna stress ourselves anymore!\n\nAs we leave the premises, people at front desk just took our keys. No questions. Didn't even check our room and just let us go. Totally a horrible experience. Can't forget the unlit hallways leading to the elevator. We're scared for life we thought we'd never get out of there alive.

Staff is very polite but room service was atrocious. For the price we paid we could have been in a better hotel with more amenities. We were charged 30 dollars to gain access to our room early, 9th floor and no phone in the room to call front desk. Our shower flooded the bathroom because the shower stall doesn’t close. Several children and adults and only 2 towels. Half  used toilet paper roll and no extra , and no soap. The key to the room controls all the power. My family went shopping and I stayed in the room. The key controls the elevators too. Once the key is removed from the hotel room it shuts off all power and I was left in the dark with no lights, AC and power to charge my phone. No complimentary breakfast. I ordered two big beds for the family and children and we were given two small individual beds that hold 1 person each. Smallest room around 10x10. We expected more from this hotel but sadly this was our worst experience so far. There are better hotels to choose from for the price. Taxes were nearly 40% of the room rate so we spent about 5000 pesos for the 1 night that included 1500 pesos early check in. Ridiculous.

Real Window, so you can get in fresh ocean air (in the morning, it is Manila...).\nLocation: Sea side of Makati, in front of the Mall of Asia. A lot of shops and restaurants (and Laundry shops, and massage, and...) around the corner or just in front of the hotel, 10 Minutes Walk to the MOA. In the night nice view to the lights of the MOA. You have a nice small rooftop pool, BBQ at the roof, a \""more than good enough\"" Restaurant (Golden Spices) in the Hotel, a spacious Bar/Bistro (Amore) at the 2nd floor.\nA little bit funny: You need to take the escalators (or elevator) to get to the 2nd floor and then walk to the guest Elevators, maybe not the first choice if you can not/hardly walk.\nWe would always book this Hotel again, the Service is so friendly, rooms are high and spacious, Price is affordable, environment is great... Fast check in: The registration form was already pre-filled, so the whole check in process needs something like 2 Minutes, that's very fast for the Philippines.\nRoom and shower (good for 2) are absolute clean, the bathroom mirror are 95% brilliant clean, the room mirror is 100% brilliant clean. to compare: In average, also in good hotels, the mirrors look like a child played on it with ice cream and a nutella bread...\nTowels are fluffy, and the bedding and linen are super soft and smooth and silky. In a rainy season you can easy spend 2 Days only at the hotel because everything is wide and bright. I can not understand other complains here, but i am happy to become curious and test it for ourself.\nInternet could have a bigger capacity, but Ping is very good (191 ms to denic/germany). One of the fastest possible pin gin the Philippines. Download is not that amazing, i think their Bandwidth is short for a lot of customers. But good enough for Video Calls!\n6 elevators, but only 2 for the guest, means Apartment renter use their own elevators. Both guest elevators working, short waiting times, access only by keycard.\nBreakfast is Asian style, no continental breakfast. But good enough for 2 or more days. Skip the \""German Frank\"" or \""German Sausage\"", they are horrible. Everything else was good and eatable, also a good Price/Quality (750 Pesos)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN7Fzf286WUJVha45Qp-gQsa8gAertUdRpGyJbF""],""When"":""2024-10-12""}]",

Fortunately, we stumbled upon 8Hostel, conveniently located near the University of the East within walking distance and 7/11 store.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to find that the price for our stay at 8Hostel was budget-friendly (I booked via Agoda), and the establishment itself was clean and well-maintained. Our experience was further improved by the warm hospitality of Ate Marissa, who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay.

I booked mine directly through their website but I called to make it easier for me to reserve a room, prices vary depending on how you book, which room you pick and if it includes breakfast (get the breakfast, it's good.) Location is easy to access since it's beside the main road of Dr Acadio Santos Ave, and it's easy to see since you also have a picture of the front of the hotel and a map to use from their website. I paid 1000 php for a downpayment since that option was cheaper instead of paying their standard rate for walk-ins. You get an email when you reserve and another email to confirm your deposit. The one who answered my call was kind to answer my questions and clarifications without any fuss. When I arrived there, their entrance is on the side of the bldg beside the entrance to the subdivision nearby. The security guard was kind enough to assist us with parking and even suggested where to park my motorcycle for better safety, they have parking in front of the bldg and behind it. The receptionist was kind and gave a nice greeting and was pleasant to talk to. I paid the balance for the room and shown my valid ID for security reasons, and then the ID card was given afterwards. You'd think it might be noisy inside the rooms being the hotel is beside the main road, but they actually have options for quieter rooms which was facing the subdivision instead of the main road (That's what I picked since I work remotely at night).\nThe AC was good, TV screen quality was good, but I plugged in my laptop and didn't use their modem for channels (I prefer Netflix hehe). It was also spacious like the bathroom. They provided toiletries like towels, soap toothbrush and toothpaste, and even a cotton pad for make up I think, as well as a few cotton swabs. Body wash and shampoo was in a dispenser in the shower, their sink is big enough to be comfortable using without spilling any water on your feet and the toilet flushes nicely. The bed is soft and they provided a blanket and 2 pillows. They also have some hangers for your clothes and a blow dryer for your hair. At night it was quiet and the lighting in the room was good, they even have a night light beside the bed that we used since we didn't want it too bright. Outside food was allowed, we had pizza delivered directly our room, courtesy of hotel staff picking up the food up and the change as well. Early in the morning we still had leftover pizza that the hotel staff gladly reheated for us, and they also have an electric kettle upon request. Two 350ml water bottles were provided upon our arrival and 2 more the following day, for free (when we asked our pizza to be reheated, we also ordered some beverages, you pay for it as you get in your room). In the morning, breakfast is served at 7am to 10am. If you took this option, which I hope you did, you will be treated to a hearty meal with free coffee or water to flush it down. We called prior going down so the meals arrived at our table rather quickly. Our options were Lumpiang Shanghai and Pork Tocino, both had an additional fried egg, We tried both and we loved both. The first extra rice you get is FREE, for me who loves extra rice this was a blessing hahaha. Afterwards we enjoyed our free coffee and Milo, they even prepared it for us. We checked out around 30 mins before time and it was simply and easy, I just handed our card they checked the room, and then they returned my security deposit. It was raining that time so we chilled in the lobby for the meantime. Overall the experience was great, the room was great, the staff was pleasant, and the food was delicious. 10/10 will book here again."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",
