Sea salt top balanced all the sweetness, coffee flavor, and the milk. Price is steep. Best consumed without the straw. Must try.\n\nService:\n- Quick\n- Has a fob to alert when order is ready\n- Self service for service water, straws, and cup covers\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Modern cafe vibe\n- Has an obstructed view of the MOA Eye\n- Place isn't that cold\n- Cafe is open, expect noise\n\nVerdict:\nCoffee is amazing.

Lights are also dim too, unless your chair is near the window. The overlooking view of the seaside is relaxing. Perfect place to tambay and chill.\n\nThe high chair for long tables near the window are ergonomic because it allows me to fully see the overview of seaside. But using the same high chair on most of the tables, I think, is not comfortable to me. The table is a bit low for the height of the chair, so if you’re planning to stay long in this cafe, choose the tables near the entrance (normal height of chair and table) or near the windows (use high table and chair).\n\nSelection of pastries and sweets are good too, but a bit pricey for me for its portion. Tried their Strawberry Blush Crunch Cake for experience, but it’s really not for my liking. I really don’t like Strawberry because it has a sour aftertaste. I only ate the chocolate topping.\n\nCold Salted Caramel Mocha drink is just fine to me. But, I like the way that they literally add a salted caramel cube above the drink, aside from the flavor itself of the drink.\n\nThe staffs were not that friendly or welcoming, though.

They do inform you of what is available or not before ordering. The downside is that the service is quite slow. We waited more than 20 minutes for our drinks and food. It might just be because the place is quite full, though.\n\nFood offerings are quite limited. The only available at that time was this Oreo cheesecake type of cake (not sure of the name).

But using the same high chair on most of the tables, I think, is not comfortable to me. The table is a bit low for the height of the chair, so if you’re planning to stay long in this cafe, choose the tables near the entrance (normal height of chair and table) or near the windows (use high table and chair).\n\nSelection of pastries and sweets are good too, but a bit pricey for me for its portion. Tried their Strawberry Blush Crunch Cake for experience, but it’s really not for my liking. I really don’t like Strawberry because it has a sour aftertaste. I only ate the chocolate topping.\n\nCold Salted Caramel Mocha drink is just fine to me. But, I like the way that they literally add a salted caramel cube above the drink, aside from the flavor itself of the drink.\n\nThe staffs were not that friendly or welcoming, though.

The staff is also unable to control people sitting on their seats who aren't customers.

Ended up ordering an iced Americano.\n\nThe interior had a nice contrast in layout with low tables, long tables for groups, counter tables, booth seats, and round tables. It had a trendy vibe but lacked coherence in the décor, feeling somewhat cluttered. It seemed more geared towards socializing than focusing on the food. The air conditioning was excellent.\n\nThe food arrived in about 10 minutes. It consisted of carbs, meat, eggs, and vegetables, a typical breakfast menu. The waffle was terrible, resembling Binangkal more than a waffle. I thought it might be a typical pancake batter substitute, but it was worse than expected.\n\nHowever, the sausage was exceptionally delicious. It had a great flavor, balance of herbs, oil content, and size, absolutely perfect. The omelet was standard, made with milk, salt, and butter, and the salad was typical with grainy mustard sauce.\n\nThe coffee could have been better with higher quality beans.\n\nThe sausage was really good.
