        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>
          See a random 1 star Google Maps review. Does it bore you? Hit 😴. Does
          it bring you joy? Hit 😆. Repeat.
        </p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
          Trying new things can be scary. It doesn't always go as planned.
          Sometimes, it goes hilariously wrong.

          This site is dedicated to all the misery, perceived or real, enshrined
          on Google Maps.
